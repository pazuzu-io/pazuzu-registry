What is Pazuzu?
---------------
Pazuzu is a tool that builds Docker images from feature snippets, while 
resolving all dependencies between them. One of the common use cases is 
Continuous Integration environment, where jobs require specific tooling present 
for building and testing. Pazuzu can significantly ease that process, by letting user 
choose from a wide selection of predefined Dockerfile snippets that represent 
those dependencies (e.g. Golang, Python, Android SDK, customized NPM installs). 

What is Pazuzu Registry?
------------------------
Pazuzu Registry is a central storage of features, together with their 
dependencies and test cases. You can access it by command line and
request your custom Dockerfile which you can pipe to Docker build
command.

What is current stage?
----------------------
Project is still in early stages - this file will be updated to reflect the 
progress and document usage and functionality

How to start the server locally (without OAuth)
-----------------------------------------------
```bash
mvn clean install
java -jar target/pazuzu-registry.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev

The server can also be started with the `dev-clean` profile. This profile 
will start the application with a clean DB if the pre provisioned feature
are not needed.
